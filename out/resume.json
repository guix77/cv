    "brief": "After 17 years as a web developer, I recently acquired an extensive experience into blockchain development, as Talao's lead developer. I'm now looking for new challenges either in startups in a major role, or in well-established compagnies as a technical partner. I only work in remote from Toulouse (but can travel from time to time), and at max 4 days a week (I dedicate 1 day/week to personal projects). Thanks for your interest!"
